# Security Camera Program

This program is made primarily using the OpenCv module. When ran, the program will start recording using the default camera. 
When the program detects a face or body it will record until it does not detect either or for 5 seconds. The recorded footage will be stored in the directory in which the python file is located.


## Installation
Make sure you have downloaded the OpenCv module
```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
```
